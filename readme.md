This is currently a bare skeleton C# SimConnect project, which connects to Microsoft Flight Simulator and reports back the user's current position every second in altitude and lat/lon.

Over the coming days I plan to fetch data on points of interest from Wikipedia via web services and show a map and article extracts.

But for now, it's just a start on getting a working SimConnect app. :)
